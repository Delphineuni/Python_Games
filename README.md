# Choice Game
Uses: dragons_story.py, save.txt
Creates a pygame window with a story and buttons depending on what's in the dragons_story.py, (position, number of buttons with different choice, etc.)

# Dragon Story
The file contains a dict{} with the position in the story, the story text, the buttons text and which position to go for each button

# First Try
A simple Snake game using input.py for inputs

# Input
A file for keyboard inputs, it detects either QWERTY or AZERTY and sends the correct inputs back to the game
